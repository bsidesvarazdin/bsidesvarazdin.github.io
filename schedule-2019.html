          <div class="block">
              Adobe Flash used to be a crowd favorite when it comes to exploiting web browsers with over 20 0day attacks using Flash vulnerabilities caught in the wild during the last 5 years. As a consequence of this trend and Flash's eventual deprecation, major web browsers don't play Flash content by default any more and now require user interaction in order to play it, aka click2play. This means that an attacker sitting on a stockpile of unpatched Flash vulnerabilities now needs a click2play bypass for those vulnerabilities to become relevant again.
          </div>
          <div class="block">
              In this talk we will dive into the good, the bad and the ugly of click2play implementations in two major web browsers (Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge). I will show how I discovered several weaknesses in those implementations, including a full click2play bypass in Microsoft Edge.

          <div class="block">
              Windows desktop and servers contain a large number of legitimate tools which can also be used by attackers, once they obtain initial access. This presentation describes those tools and their usage in real world attacks.
          </div>
          <div class="block">
              Centralised logging and telemetry provides a wealth of information for blue team members and their day to day operations. These sources usually contain enough data to detect when attackers were successful in compromising the defended network.
          </div>
          <div class="block">
              But how to recognise a successful attack when the tools the attackers are using are also legitimate system administration utilities? Most Windows administrators would agree that PowerShell is an essential system administration tool but it has also been frequently seen as an attack avenue for attackers and red team activities.
          </div>
          <div class="block">
              Powershell is typically used to load code from remote servers and make the attacks “fileless” using reflective dll loading, steal user credentials, pivot within the compromised network, maintain persistence and execute other offensive tasks.
          </div>
          <div class="block">
              Right from the initial compromise, we can expect attackers to use standard Windows tools for enumerating network resources, adding new users, pivoting to other servers, dumping databases, exfiltrating data etc.
          </div>
          <div class="block">
              This session will be a walk through attackers techniques using tools which can also be considered legitimate and are usually installed by default on Windows. We will talk about basic and advanced functionality of this legitimate attack arsenal and show its usage observed during recent attacks.
