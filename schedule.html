        <div class="block">
            During 2023, multiple Google Project Zero members joined forces to look for vulnerabilities in baseband processors on mobile phones and, in this process, discovered multiple vulnerabilities that would allow attackers to hack phones from the mobile network and beyond. This talk will cover getting started in the area of baseband security research, specifically focused on the basebands used in the latest Pixel and iPhone mobile phones. It will also cover the tooling we used, both existing and new, and show some of our findings.

            Find out what happens when you put a network tap between your TV and your router. Ever wanted to know what kind of magic needs to happen in your Set Top Box to show you your favorite TV channel? What technologies are used? What if I told you YOU could control what's displayed on your TV or watch any channel you want? In this talk, I'll explain how to inspect the inner workings of modern telco IPTV. You'll see how you can build your own network tap using nothing more than a simple Raspberry Pi and use it to inspect and modify network traffic on the fly.

        <div class="block">
            Drivers have long been of interest to threat actors, whether they are exploiting vulnerable drivers or creating malicious ones. Malicious drivers are difficult to detect and successfully leveraging one can give an attacker full access to a system.<br><br>
            With the existence of malicious drivers, there is a need for those who can analyze identified samples. This analysis requires specific knowledge of the Windows operating system, which can be difficult to acquire. Windows drivers and the kernel can be overwhelming to learn about, as these topics are vast and highly complex. The documentation available on these subjects is daunting and difficult to navigate for newcomers, even for those with programming experience. <br><br>
            This initial hurdle and steep learning curve create a high barrier of entry into the subject. To many, the kernel space seems to be an arcane and hidden part of the operating system. <br><br>
            This presentation will be a high-level introduction into drivers, their usage by malicious actors and the Windows kernel. No previous experience of drivers is required.<br><br>
